abstract = {Summary The ability to perturb genes in human cells is crucial for elucidating gene function and holds great potential for finding therapeutic targets for diseases such as cancer. To extend the catalog of human core and context-dependent fitness genes, we have developed a high-complexity second-generation genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 gRNA library and applied it to fitness screens in five human cell lines. Using an improved Bayesian analytical approach, we consistently discover 5-fold more fitness genes than were previously observed. We present a list of 1,580 human core fitness genes and describe their general properties. Moreover, we demonstrate that context-dependent fitness genes accurately recapitulate pathway-specific genetic vulnerabilities induced by known oncogenes and reveal cell-type-specific dependencies for specific receptor tyrosine kinases, even in oncogenic KRAS backgrounds. Thus, rigorous identification of human cell line fitness genes using a high-complexity CRISPR-Cas9 library affords a high-resolution view of the genetic vulnerabilities of a cell.},

@article{Lause2020,
abstract = {Standard preprocessing of single-cell RNA-seq UMI data includes normalization by sequencing depth to remove this technical variability, and nonlinear transformation to stabilize the variance across genes with different expression levels. Instead, two recent papers propose to use statistical count models for these tasks: Hafemeister and Satija (2019) recommend using Pearson residuals from negative binomial regression, while Townes et al. (2019) recommend fitting a generalized PCA model. Here, we investigate the connection between these approaches theoretically and empirically, and compare their effects on downstream processing. We show that the model of Hafemeister and Satija (2019) produces noisy parameter estimates because it is overspecified (which is why the original paper employs post-hoc regularization). When specified more parsimoniously, it has a simple analytic solution equivalent to the rank-one Poisson GLM-PCA of Townes et al. (2019). Further, our analysis indicates that per-gene overdispersion estimates in Hafemeister and Satija (2019) are biased, and that the data analyzed in that paper are in fact consistent with constant overdispersion parameter across genes. We then use negative control data without biological variability to estimate the technical overdispersion of UMI counts, and find that across several different experimental protocols, the data suggest very moderate overdispersion. Finally, we argue that analytic Pearson residuals (or, equivalently, rank-one GLM-PCA or negative binomial regression after regularization) strongly outperform standard preprocessing for identifying biologically variable genes, and capture more biologically meaningful variation when used for dimensionality reduction, compared to other methods.},

abstract = {Functional genomics efforts face tradeoffs between number of perturbations examined and complexity of phenotypes measured. We bridge this gap with Perturb-seq, which combines droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq with a strategy for barcoding CRISPR-mediated perturbations, allowing many perturbations to be profiled in pooled format. We applied Perturb-seq to dissect the mammalian unfolded protein response (UPR) using single and combinatorial CRISPR perturbations. Two genome-scale CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens identified genes whose repression perturbs ER homeostasis. Subjecting âˆ¼100 hits to Perturb-seq enabled high-precision functional clustering of genes. Single-cell analyses decoupled the three UPR branches, revealed bifurcated UPR branch activation among cells subject to the same perturbation, and uncovered differential activation of the branches across hits, including an isolated feedback loop between the translocon and IRE1$\alpha$. These studies provide insight into how the three sensors of ER homeostasis monitor distinct types of stress and highlight the ability of Perturb-seq to dissect complex cellular responses.},

@article{Ibrahim1992,
abstract = {This article examines incomplete data for the class of generalized linear models, in which incompleteness is due to partially missing covariates on some observations. Under the assumption that the missing data are missing at random, it is shown that the E step of the EM algorithm for any generalized linear model can be expressed as a weighted complete data log-likelihood when the unobserved covariates are assumed to come from a discrete distribution with finite range. Expressing the E step in this manner allows for a straightforward maximization in the M step, thus leading to maximum likelihood estimates (MLE's) for the parameters. Asymptotic variances of the MLE's are also derived, and results are illustrated with two examples.},

High-content phenotyping approaches such as Perturb-seq (single-cell RNA-sequencing pooled CRISPR screens) present an opportunity for exploring such genetic interactions (GIs) at scale. Here, we present an analytical framework for interpreting high-dimensional landscapes of cell states (manifolds) constructed from transcriptional phenotypes. We applied this approach to Perturb-seq profiling of strong GIs mined from a growth-based, gain-of-function GI map. Exploration of this manifold enabled ordering of regulatory pathways, principled classification of GIs (e.g., identifying suppressors), and mechanistic elucidation of synergistic interactions, including an unexpected synergy between CBL and CNN1 driving erythroid differentiation. Finally, we applied recommender system machine learning to predict interactions, facilitating exploration of vastly larger GI manifolds.},

abstract = {Regression models that ignore measurement error in predictors may produce highly biased estimates leading to erroneous inferences. It is well known that it is extremely difficult to take measurement error into account in Gaussian nonparametric regression. This problem becomes tremendously more difficult when considering other families such as logistic regression, Poisson and negative-binomial. For the first time, we present a method aiming to correct for measurement error when estimating regression functions flexibly covering virtually all distributions and link functions regularly considered in generalized linear models. This approach depends on approximating the first and the second moment of the response after integrating out the true unobserved predictors in a semiparametric generalized linear model. Unlike previous methods, this method is not restricted to truncated splines and can utilize various basis functions. Through extensive simulation studies, we study the performance of our method under many scenarios.},

Here we developed a computational tool called APSiC (Analysis of Perturbation Screens for identifying novel Cancer genes) and applied it to the large-scale deep shRNA screen DRIVE1 to unveil novel genetic and non-genetic driver genes. APSiC identified both well-known and novel drivers across all cancer types and within individual cancer types. The analysis of individual cancer types revealed that cancer drivers segregate by cell of origin and that genes involved in mRNA splicing may be oncogenic or tumor suppressive depending on the cancer type. We discovered and functionally demonstrated that LRRC4B is a novel putative tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer. The analysis of DRIVE using APSiC is provided as a web portal and represents a valuable resource for the discovery of novel cancer genes.},

abstract = {The vast majority of the mammalian genome consists of DNAs that do not encode protein sequences. For decades, the functional potentials of these noncoding DNAs have remained poorly understood. Large-scale studies, such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements project and genome-wide association studies, have suggested that the noncoding genome functions in a wide variety of biological and physiological process [{\textless}a class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"{\textgreater}1{\textless}/a{\textgreater}]. However, it has been technically challenging to attribute functions to a plethora of noncoding elements in any given biological context, largely due to a lack of convenient high-throughput approaches.
The recently developed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas system enables efficient and precise perturbation of DNA sequences in the genome, thus offering an unprecedented opportunity to associate functions or phenotypes with genetic elements [{\textless}a class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"{\textgreater}2{\textless}/a{\textgreater}]. Directed by a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) with a region complementary to the target DNA, Cas nuclease cleaves the genomic DNA at the target locus to generate a double-strand DNA break (DSB), which is subsequently repaired through an internal error-prone nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, resulting in an insertion or deletion (indel) that often disrupts gene function [{\textless}a class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"{\textgreater}3{\textless}/a{\textgreater}]. The CRISPR-Cas system has been further engineered to regulate gene expression at will through the fusion of the catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) with transcriptional activators, repressors or other effectors, enabling transcriptional activation (CRISPR activation, CRISPRa), inhibition (CRISPR interference, CRISPRi) or epigenetic modifications [{\textless}a class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"{\textgreater}3{\textless}/a{\textgreater}].
Owing to its programmability and multiplexability, the CRISPR-Cas system is especially potent in high-throughput functional genomics. To achieve this, sgRNAs are designed {\textless}em{\textgreater}in silico{\textless}/em{\textgreater} and synthesized as a pool before being cloned into lentiviral vectors to generate a library of viruses for target cell transduction. After phenotypic selection, such as drug resistance/sensitivity or fluorescence-activated cell sorting, candidate genes responsible for the functions of interests are revealed through next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of sgRNA barcodes from enriched or depleted cell populations [{\textless}a class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"{\textgreater}4{\textless}/a{\textgreater}].
Despite the power of pooled CRISPR screening in the dissection of key genes in a variety of biological processes, the majority of such screens hitherto have mainly targeted protein-coding genes. This is because the small indels ({\textless}10 bp) created by NHEJ are unlikely to produce loss-of-function phenotypes on the noncoding elements. Recently, endeavors have been made to probe the noncoding regions in mammalian genome by exploiting customized CRISPR-based screens.
As much as 76{\%} of genomic DNA is transcribed into RNAs, while less than 2{\%} encodes proteins [{\textless}a class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"{\textgreater}5{\textless}/a{\textgreater}]. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are at least 200 nucleotides in length, are the major subsets of the human transcriptome [{\textless}a class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"{\textgreater}5{\textless}/a{\textgreater}]. The first high-throughput method to identify functional lncRNAs is through a specially designed CRISPR approach that employs paired gRNAs (pgRNAs) to produce genomic deletions (Fig. {\textless}a class="link link-reveal link-table xref-fig"{\textgreater}1a{\textless}/a{\textgreater}). A pgRNA library comprising 12 472 gRNA pairs specific for 671 human lncRNAs was assembled, and the screening identified 51 lncRNAs that modulate tumor cell growth [{\textless}a class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"{\textgreater}6{\textless}/a{\textgreater}]. Alternatively, CRISPRi and CRISPRa have been employed to investigate functional lncRNAs by perturbing lncRNA transcription in two opposite directions (Fig. {\textless}a class="link link-reveal link-table xref-fig"{\textgreater}1b{\textless}/a{\textgreater}). Genome-scale CRISPRi screens were performed in seven different cell lines, using an sgRNA library targeting the transcriptional start site (TSS) of 16 401 lncRNAs. This assay revealed that âˆ¼500 lncRNA loci are important for cell growth [{\textless}a class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"{\textgreater}7{\textless}/a{\textgreater}]. Intriguingly, despite more than 1300 lncRNA genes being expressed in all seven cell lines tested, none of them was identified in all screens, suggesting that lncRNAs exert distinct functions in diverse cellular contexts. Moreover, Joung {\textless}em{\textgreater}et al.{\textless}/em{\textgreater} performed a CRISPRa screen to globally map lncRNA loci relevant to drug resistance. By targeting the TSS of more than 10 000 lncRNA loci, 11 were identified whose overexpression conferred cell resistance to BRAF inhibitors [{\textless}a class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr"{\textgreater}8{\textless}/a{\textgreater}].
Although lncRNA functional screening at a genome-wide scale could be achieved, the CRISPRi and CRISPRa approaches have limitations, mainly owing to their insu

This situation commonly occurs in health-related applications where the effects of illness are modeled in a multivariate framework and where health conditions are usually 0-1 survey responses indicating the absence or presence of diseases. An analysis of the effect of psychiatric diseases on male earnings provides an empirical example that indicates extensive measurement error bias even in sophisticated survey measures that are designed to simulate clinical diagnoses. A corrected covariance matrix is constructed from a validity study of the survey mental health indicators. When ordinary least squares estimators are adjusted by this correction matrix, the estimated earnings effects drop for certain diseases (drug abuse, general phobic disorders) and rise for others (anti-social personality).},

They are based on a library of target-specific guide RNAs (gRNAs) that is applied to a pool of cells, with the aim to induce a single genetic perturbation in each cell. Detection of viability phenotypes depends on statistical comparison of the frequencies of these gRNAs before and after cell proliferation. Here, we report empirical and theoretical evidence for asymmetries in gRNA count ratios, and we show how failure to consider asymmetric null distribution of the data leads to loss of detection power. We present a biology-based, generative probabilistic model to show that the asymmetry is generated during the proliferation phase of the screen and that it is mainly driven by the distribution width of the gRNA library. Based on these observations we develop a statistical test that improves hit detection at reduced experiment size. The method is implemented in the open source package 'gscreend' (submission to Bioconductor pending).},

However, the design of current studies limits their application to identifying the primary gene targets of enhancers. Here, we improve the experimental and computational parameters of single-cell enhancer screens to identify the secondary gene targets of enhancers. Our analysis of {\textgreater}500 putative enhancers in K562 cells reveals an interwoven enhancer-driven gene regulatory network. We find that enhancers from distinct genomic loci converge to modulate the expression of common sub-modules, including the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-globin loci, by directly regulating transcription factors. Our analysis suggests that several genetic variants associated with myeloid blood cell traits alter the activity of a distal enhancer of MYB (âˆ¼140 kb away), with downstream consequences on hemoglobin genes expression and cell state. These data have implications for the understanding of enhancer-associated traits and emphasize the flexibility of controlling transcriptional systems by modifying enhancer activity.},

abstract = {The majority of genetic variants associated with common human diseases map to enhancers, non-coding elements that shape cell-type-specific transcriptional programs and responses to extracellular cues1-3. Systematic mapping of functional enhancers and their biological contexts is required to understand the mechanisms by which variation in non-coding genetic sequences contributes to disease. Functional enhancers can be mapped by genomic sequence disruption4-6, but this approach is limited to the subset of enhancers that are necessary in the particular cellular context being studied. We hypothesized that recruitment of a strong transcriptional activator to an enhancer would be sufficient to drive target gene expression, even if that enhancer was not currently active in the assayed cells. Here we describe a discovery platform that can identify stimulus-responsive enhancers for a target gene independent of stimulus exposure. We used tiled CRISPR activation (CRISPRa)7 to synthetically recruit a transcriptional activator to sites across large genomic regions (more than 100 kilobases) surrounding two key autoimmunity risk loci, CD69 and IL2RA. We identified several CRISPRa-responsive elements with chromatin features of stimulus-responsive enhancers, including an IL2RA enhancer that harbours an autoimmunity risk variant. Using engineered mouse models, we found that sequence perturbation of the disease-associated Il2ra enhancer did not entirely block Il2ra expression, but rather delayed the timing of gene activation in response to specific extracellular signals. Enhancer deletion skewed polarization of naive T cells towards a pro-inflammatory T helper (TH17) cell state and away from a regulatory T cell state. This integrated approach identifies functional enhancers and reveals how non-coding variation associated with human immune dysfunction alters context-specific gene programs.},

abstract = {The current paradigm of genomic studies of complex diseases is association and correlation analysis. Despite significant progress in dissecting the genetic architecture of complex diseases by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the identified genetic variants by GWAS can only explain a small proportion of the heritability of complex diseases. A large fraction of genetic variants is still hidden. Association analysis has limited power to unravel mechanisms of complex diseases. It is time to shift the paradigm of genomic analysis from association analysis to causal inference. Causal inference is an essential component for the discovery of mechanism of diseases. This paper will review the major platforms of the genomic analysis in the past and discuss the perspectives of causal inference as a general framework of genomic analysis. In genomic data analysis, we usually consider four types of associations: association of discrete variables (DNA variation) with continuous variables (phenotypes and gene expressions), association of continuous variables (expressions, methylations, and imaging signals) with continuous variables (gene expressions, imaging signals, phenotypes, and physiological traits), association of discrete variables (DNA variation) with binary trait (disease status) and association of continuous variables (gene expressions, methylations, phenotypes, and imaging signals) with binary trait (disease status). In this paper, we will review algorithmic information theory as a general framework for causal discovery and the recent development of statistical methods for causal inference on discrete data, and discuss the possibility of extending the association analysis of discrete variable with disease to the causal analysis for discrete variable and disease.},

abstract = {Over one million candidate regulatory elements have been identified across the human genome, but nearly all are unvalidated and their target genes uncertain. Approaches based on human genetics are limited in scope to common variants and in resolution by linkage disequilibrium. We present a multiplex, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)-inspired framework for mapping enhancer-gene pairs by introducing random combinations of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated perturbations to each of many cells, followed by single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Across two experiments, we used dCas9-KRAB to perturb 5,920 candidate enhancers with no strong a priori hypothesis as to their target gene(s), measuring effects by profiling 254,974 single-cell transcriptomes. We identified 664 (470 high-confidence) cis enhancer-gene pairs, which were enriched for specific transcription factors, non-housekeeping status, and genomic and 3D conformational proximity to their target genes. This framework will facilitate the large-scale mapping of enhancer-gene regulatory interactions, a critical yet largely uncharted component of the cis-regulatory landscape of the human genome.},

abstract = {The transcriptome contains rich information on molecular, cellular and organismal phenotypes. However, experimental and statistical limitations constrain sensitivity and throughput of genetic screening with single-cell transcriptomics readout. To overcome these limitations, we introduce targeted Perturb-seq (TAP-seq), a sensitive, inexpensive and platform-independent method focusing single-cell RNA-seq coverage on genes of interest, thereby increasing the sensitivity and scale of genetic screens by orders of magnitude. TAP-seq permits routine analysis of thousands of CRISPR-mediated perturbations within a single experiment, detects weak effects and lowly expressed genes, and decreases sequencing requirements by up to 50-fold. We apply TAP-seq to generate perturbation-based enhancerâ€“target gene maps for 1,778 enhancers within 2.5{\%} of the human genome. We thereby show that enhancerâ€“target association is jointly determined by three-dimensional contact frequency and epigenetic states, allowing accurate prediction of enhancer targets throughout the genome. In addition, we demonstrate that TAP-seq can identify cell subtypes with only 100 sequencing reads per cell.},

abstract = {Motivation: Functional genomics (FG) screens, using RNAi or CRISPR technology, have become a standard tool for systematic, genome-wide loss-of-function studies for therapeutic target discovery. As in many large-scale assays, however, off-target effects, variable reagents' potency and experimental noise must be accounted for appropriately control for false positives. Indeed, rigorous statistical analysis of high-throughput FG screening data remains challenging, particularly when integrative analyses are used to combine multiple sh/sgRNAs targeting the same gene in the library. Method: We use large RNAi and CRISPR repositories that are publicly available to evaluate a novel meta-analysis approach for FG screens via Bayesian hierarchical modeling, Screening Bayesian Evaluation and Analysis Method (ScreenBEAM). Results: Results from our analysis show that the proposed strategy, which seamlessly combines all available data, robustly outperforms classical algorithms developed for microarray data sets as well as recent approaches designed for next generation sequencing technologies. Remarkably, the ScreenBEAM algorithm works well even when the quality of FG screens is relatively low, which accounts for about 80-95{\%} of the public datasets.

abstract = {Scientists often embed cells into a lower-dimensional space when studying single-cell RNA-seq data for improved downstream analyses such as developmental trajectory analyses, but the statistical properties of such nonlinear embedding methods are often not well understood. In this article, we develop the exponential-family SVD (eSVD), a nonlinear embedding method for both cells and genes jointly with respect to a random dot product model using exponential-family distributions. Our estimator uses alternating minimization, which enables us to have a computationally efficient method, prove the identifiability conditions and consistency of our method, and provide statistically principled procedures to tune our method. All these qualities help advance the single-cell embedding literature, and we provide extensive simulations to demonstrate that the eSVD is competitive compared to other embedding methods. We apply the eSVD via Gaussian distributions where the standard deviations are proportional to the means to analyze a single-cell dataset of oligodendrocytes in mouse brains. Using the eSVD estimated embedding, we then investigate the cell developmental trajectories of the oligodendrocytes. While previous results are not able to distinguish the trajectories among the mature oligodendrocyte cell types, our diagnostics and results demonstrate there are two major developmental trajectories that diverge at mature oligodendrocytes.

Previously, we identified an erythroid enhancer of human BCL11A, subject to common genetic variation associated with the fetal haemoglobin level, the mouse orthologue of which is necessary for erythroid BCL11A expression. Here we develop pooled clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 guide RNA libraries to perform in situ saturating mutagenesis of the human and mouse enhancers. This approach reveals critical minimal features and discrete vulnerabilities of these enhancers. Despite conserved function of the composite enhancers, their architecture diverges. The crucial human sequences appear to be primate-specific. Through editing of primary human progenitors and mouse transgenesis, we validate the BCL11A erythroid enhancer as a target for fetal haemoglobin reinduction. The detailed enhancer map will inform therapeutic genome editing, and the screening approach described here is generally applicable to functional interrogation of non-coding genomic elements.},

This article proposes a general score test statistic for comparing a ZNB regression model to the NB model and the test is extended to a composite score test. Simulation results indicate that the test performs reasonably well and has a sampling distribution under the null hypothesis (NB model) approximated by the usual $\chi$2 distribution. Use of the test is illustrated on a set of apple shoot propagation data. The composite score test is found to indicate suitable models.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of benign overfitting is one of the key mysteries uncovered by deep learning methodology: deep neural networks seem to predict well, even with a perfect fit to noisy training data. Motivated by this phenomenon, we consider when a perfect fit to training data in linear regression is compatible with accurate prediction. We give a characterization of linear regression problems for which the minimum norm interpolating prediction rule has near-optimal prediction accuracy. The characterization is in terms of two notions of the effective rank of the data covariance. It shows that overparameterization is essential for benign overfitting in this setting: the number of directions in parameter space that are unimportant for prediction must significantly exceed the sample size. By studying examples of data covariance properties that this characterization shows are required for benign overfitting, we find an important role for finite-dimensional data: the accuracy of the minimum norm interpolating prediction rule approaches the best possible accuracy for a much narrower range of properties of the data distribution when the data lie in an infinite-dimensional space vs. when the data lie in a finite-dimensional space with dimension that grows faster than the sample size.},

We propose that the Pearson residuals from "regularized negative binomial regression," where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression.

abstract = {Until recently, high-throughput gene expression technology, such asRNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) required hundreds of thousands of cells to produce reliable measurements. Recent technical advances permit genome-wide gene expression measurement at the single-cell level. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) is the most widely used and numerous publications are based on data produced with this technology. However, RN A-seq and scRNA-seq data are markedly different. In particular, unlike RNA-seq, the majority ofreported expression levels in scRNA-seq are zeros, which could be either biologically-driven, genes not expressing RNA at the time of measurement, or technically-driven, genes expressing RNA, but not at a sufficient level to be detected by sequencing technology. Another difference is that the proportion of genes reporting the expression level to be zero varies substantially across single cells compared to RNA-seq samples. However, it remains unclear to what extent this cell-to-cell variation is being driven by technical rather than biological variation. Furthermore, while systematic errors, including batch effects, have been widely reported as a major challenge in high-throughput technologies, these issues have received minimal attention in published studies based on scRNA-seq technology. Here, we use an assessment experiment to examine data from published studies and demonstrate that systematic errors can explain a substantial percentage of observed cell-to-cell expression variability. Specifically, we present evidence that some of these reported zeros are driven by technical variation by demonstrating that scRNA-seq produces more zeros than expected and that this bias is greater for lower expressed genes. In addition, this missing data problem is exacerbated by the fact that this technical variation varies cell-to-cell. Then, we show how this technical cell-to-cell variability can be confused with novel biological results. Finally, we demonstrate and discuss how batch-effects and confounded experiments can intensify the problem.},

Among the genes identified, seven genes, EMC2, EMC3, SEL1L, DERL2, UBE2G2, UBE2J1, and HRD1, stood out as having the strongest phenotype, whose knockout conferred strong protection against WNVinduced cell death with two different WNV strains and in three cell lines. Interestingly, knockout of these genes did not block WNV replication. Thus, these appear to be essential genes that link WNV replication to downstream cell death pathway(s). In addition, the fact that all of these genes belong to the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway suggests that this might be the primary driver of WNV-induced cell death.},

abstract = {Background: The advent of high throughput RNA-seq at the single-cell level has opened up new opportunities to elucidate the heterogeneity of gene expression. One of the most widespread applications of RNA-seq is to identify genes which are differentially expressed between two experimental conditions. Results: We present a discrete, distributional method for differential gene expression (D3E), a novel algorithm specifically designed for single-cell RNA-seq data. We use synthetic data to evaluate D3E, demonstrating that it can detect changes in expression, even when the mean level remains unchanged. Since D3E is based on an analytically tractable stochastic model, it provides additional biological insights by quantifying biologically meaningful properties, such as the average burst size and frequency. We use D3E to investigate experimental data, and with the help of the underlying model, we directly test hypotheses about the driving mechanism behind changes in gene expression. Conclusion: Evaluation using synthetic data shows that D3E performs better than other methods for identifying differentially expressed genes since it is designed to take full advantage of the information available from single-cell RNA-seq experiments. Moreover, the analytical model underlying D3E makes it possible to gain additional biological insights.},

We used it to interrogate the 2-Mb POU5F1 locus in human embryonic stem cells, and identified 45 cis-regulatory elements. A majority of these elements have active chromatin marks, DNase hypersensitivity, and occupancy by multiple transcription factors, which confirms the utility of chromatin signatures in cis-element mapping.

However, scRNA-seq data are noisy, with each cell typically sequenced at low cov erage, thus making it difficult to infer properties of the gene expression distribution from raw counts. Based on a reexamina tion of nine public datasets, we propose a simple technical noise model for scRNA-seq data with unique molecular identifiers (UMI) We develop deconvolution of single-cell expression distribution (DESCEND), a method that deconvolves the true cross-cell gene expression distribution from observed scRNA-seq counts, lead ing to improved estimates of properties of the distribution such as dispersion and nonzero fraction. DESCEND can adjust for cell level covariates such as cell size, cell cycle, and batch effects DESCEND's noise model and estimation accuracy are further eval uated through comparisons to RNA FISH data, through data split ting and simulations and through its effectiveness in removing known batch effects.

These assumptions should be justifiable on substantive grounds, but are often motivated by mathematical convenience, for the sake of exactly identifying the target of inference. We adopt the view that it is preferable to present bounds under justifiable assumptions than to pursue exact identification under dubious ones. To that end, we demonstrate how a broad class of modeling assumptions involving discrete variables, including common measurement error and conditional independence assumptions, can be expressed as linear constraints on the parameters of the model. We then use linear programming techniques to produce sharp bounds for factual and counterfactual distributions under measurement error in such models. We additionally propose a procedure for obtaining outer bounds on non-linear models. Our method yields sharp bounds in a number of important settings -- such as the instrumental variable scenario with measurement error -- for which no bounds were previously known.},

However, the coverage and replicate requirements result in large experiment sizes, which are limiting when samples are scarce, or the protocols are expensive and laborious. Here, we present an approach to reduce the scale of genome-wide perturbation screens up to fivefold without sacrificing performance. To do so, we deliver two randomly paired gRNAs into each cell, and rely on recent advances in gRNA design, as well as availability of gRNA effect measurements, to reduce the number of gRNAs per gene. We designed a human genome-wide library that has effective size of 30,000 constructs, yet targets each gene with three gRNAs. Our minimized double guide RNA library gives similar results to a standard single gRNA one, but using substantially fewer cells. We demonstrate that genome-wide screens can be optimized in a demanding model of induced pluripotent stem cells, reducing reagent cost 70{\%} per replicate compared to conventional approach, while retaining high performance. The screen design and the reduction in scale it provides will enable functional genomics experiments across many possible combinations of environments and genetic backgrounds, as well as in hard to obtain and culture primary cells.},

abstract = {Background: The analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data plays an important role in understanding the intrinsic and extrinsic cellular processes in biological and biomedical research. One significant effort in this area is the detection of differentially expressed (DE) genes. scRNAseq data, however, are highly heterogeneous and have a large number of zero counts, which introduces challenges in detecting DE genes. Addressing these challenges requires employing new approaches beyond the conventional ones, which are based on a nonzero difference in average expression. Several methods have been developed for differential gene expression analysis of scRNAseq data. To provide guidance on choosing an appropriate tool or developing a new one, it is necessary to evaluate and compare the performance of differential gene expression analysis methods for scRNAseq data. Results: In this study, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of eleven differential gene expression analysis software tools, which are designed for scRNAseq data or can be applied to them. We used simulated and real data to evaluate the accuracy and precision of detection. Using simulated data, we investigated the effect of sample size on the detection accuracy of the tools. Using real data, we examined the agreement among the tools in identifying DE genes, the run time of the tools, and the biological relevance of the detected DE genes. Conclusions: In general, agreement among the tools in calling DE genes is not high. There is a trade-off between true-positive rates and the precision of calling DE genes. Methods with higher true positive rates tend to show low precision due to their introducing false positives, whereas methods with high precision show low true positive rates due to identifying few DE genes. We observed that current methods designed for scRNAseq data do not tend to show better performance compared to methods designed for bulk RNAseq data. Data multimodality and abundance of zero read counts are the main characteristics of scRNAseq data, which play important roles in the performance of differential gene expression analysis methods and need to be considered in terms of the development of new methods.},

abstract = {Background: Clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screens are usually implemented in cultured cells to identify genes with critical functions. Although several methods have been developed or adapted to analyze CRISPR screening data, no single specific algorithm has gained popularity. Thus, rigorous procedures are needed to overcome the shortcomings of existing algorithms. Methods: We developed a Permutation-Based Non-Parametric Analysis (PBNPA) algorithm, which computes p-values at the gene level by permuting sgRNA labels, and thus it avoids restrictive distributional assumptions. Although PBNPA is designed to analyze CRISPR data, it can also be applied to analyze genetic screens implemented with siRNAs or shRNAs and drug screens. Results: We compared the performance of PBNPA with competing methods on simulated data as well as on real data. PBNPA outperformed recent methods designed for CRISPR screen analysis, as well as methods used for analyzing other functional genomics screens, in terms of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves and False Discovery Rate (FDR) control for simulated data under various settings. Remarkably, the PBNPA algorithm showed better consistency and FDR control on published real data as well. Conclusions: PBNPA yields more consistent and reliable results than its competitors, especially when the data quality is low. R package of PBNPA is available at: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PBNPA/.},

abstract = {Missing data refers to a class of problems made difficult by the absence of some portions of a familiar data structure. For example, a regression problem might have some missing values in the predictor vectors. This article concerns nonparametric approaches to assessing the accuracy of an estimator in a missing data situation. Three main topics are discussed: bootstrap methods for missing data, these methods' relationship to the theory of multiple imputation, and computationally efficient ways of executing them. The simplest form of nonparametric bootstrap confidence interval turns out to give convenient and accurate answers. There are interesting practical and theoretical differences between bootstrap methods and the multiple imputation approach, as well as some useful similarities. {\textcopyright} 1994 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Heterogeneity in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data is driven by multiple sources, including biological variation in cellular state as well as technical variation introduced during experimental processing. Deconvolving these effects is a key challenge for preprocessing workflows. Recent work has demonstrated the importance and utility of count models for scRNA-seq analysis, but there is a lack of consensus on which statistical distributions and parameter settings are appropriate. Here, we analyze 58 scRNA-seq datasets that span a wide range of technologies, systems, and sequencing depths in order to evaluate the performance of different error models. We find that while a Poisson error model appears appropriate for sparse datasets, we observe clear evidence of overdispersion for genes with sufficient sequencing depth in all biological systems, necessitating the use of a negative binomial model. Moreover, we find that the degree of overdispersion varies widely across datasets, systems, and gene abundances, and argues for a data-driven approach for parameter estimation. Based on these analyses, we provide a set of recommendations for modeling variation in scRNA-seq data, particularly when using generalized linear models or likelihood-based approaches for preprocessing and downstream analysis.

abstract = {Differential gene expression analysis is one of the significant efforts in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis to discover the specific changes in expression levels of individual cell types. Since scRNAseq exhibits multimodality, large amounts of zero counts, and sparsity, it is different from the traditional bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data. The new challenges of scRNAseq data promote the development of new methods for identifying differentially expressed (DE) genes. In this study, we proposed a new method, SigEMD, that combines a data imputation approach, a logistic regression model and a nonparametric method based on the Earth Mover's Distance, to precisely and efficiently identify DE genes in scRNAseq data. The regression model and data imputation are used to reduce the impact of large amounts of zero counts, and the nonparametric method is used to improve the sensitivity of detecting DE genes from multimodal scRNAseq data. By additionally employing gene interaction network information to adjust the final states of DE genes, we further reduce the false positives of calling DE genes. We used simulated datasets and real datasets to evaluate the detection accuracy of the proposed method and to compare its performance with those of other differential expression analysis methods. Results indicate that the proposed method has an overall powerful performance in terms of precision in detection, sensitivity, and specificity.},
