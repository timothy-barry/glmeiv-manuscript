abstract = {Single-cell screens enable high-throughput functional assessment of enhancers in their endogenous genomic context. However, the design of current studies limits their application to identifying the primary gene targets of enhancers. Here, we improve the experimental and computational parameters of single-cell enhancer screens to identify the secondary gene targets of enhancers. Our analysis of {\textgreater}500 putative enhancers in K562 cells reveals an interwoven enhancer-driven gene regulatory network. We find that enhancers from distinct genomic loci converge to modulate the expression of common sub-modules, including the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-globin loci, by directly regulating transcription factors. Our analysis suggests that several genetic variants associated with myeloid blood cell traits alter the activity of a distal enhancer of MYB (∼140 kb away), with downstream consequences on hemoglobin genes expression and cell state. These data have implications for the understanding of enhancer-associated traits and emphasize the flexibility of controlling transcriptional systems by modifying enhancer activity.},

Here, we develop Perturb-seq, combining single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based perturbations to perform many such assays in a pool. We demonstrate Perturb-seq by analyzing 200,000 cells in immune cells and cell lines, focusing on transcription factors regulating the response of dendritic cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Perturb-seq accurately identifies individual gene targets, gene signatures, and cell states affected by individual perturbations and their genetic interactions. We posit new functions for regulators of differentiation, the anti-viral response, and mitochondrial function during immune activation. By decomposing many high content measurements into the effects of perturbations, their interactions, and diverse cell metadata, Perturb-seq dramatically increases the scope of pooled genomic assays.},

The missing covariates are assumed to come from a continuous distribution, and are assumed to be missing at random. In particular, Gaussian quadrature methods are used on the E‐step of the EM algorithm, leading to an approximate EM algorithm. The parameters are then estimated using the weighted EM procedure given in Ibrahim (1990). This approximate EM procedure leads to approximate maximum likelihood estimates, whose standard errors and asymptotic properties are given. The proposed procedure is illustrated on a data set.

abstract = {During the past 12 years, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have uncovered thousands of genetic variants that influence risk for complex human traits and diseases. Yet functional studies aimed at delineating the causal genetic variants and biological mechanisms underlying the observed statistical associations with disease risk have lagged. In this review, we highlight key advances in the field of functional genomics that may facilitate the derivation of biological meaning post-GWAS. We highlight the evidence suggesting that causal variants underlying disease risk often function through regulatory effects on the expression of target genes and that these expression effects might be modest and cell-type specific. We moreover discuss specific studies as proof-of-principle examples for current statistical, bioinformatic, and empirical bench-based approaches to downstream elucidation of GWAS-identified disease risk loci.},

Approaches based on human genetics are limited in scope to common variants and in resolution by linkage disequilibrium. We present a multiplex, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)-inspired framework for mapping enhancer-gene pairs by introducing random combinations of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated perturbations to each of many cells, followed by single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Across two experiments, we used dCas9-KRAB to perturb 5,920 candidate enhancers with no strong a priori hypothesis as to their target gene(s), measuring effects by profiling 254,974 single-cell transcriptomes. We identified 664 (470 high-confidence) cis enhancer-gene pairs, which were enriched for specific transcription factors, non-housekeeping status, and genomic and 3D conformational proximity to their target genes. This framework will facilitate the large-scale mapping of enhancer-gene regulatory interactions, a critical yet largely uncharted component of the cis-regulatory landscape of the human genome.},

abstract = {Invariance-based randomization tests -- such as permutation tests -- are an important and widely used class of statistical methods. They allow drawing inferences with few assumptions on the data distribution. Most work focuses on their type I error control properties, while their consistency properties are much less understood. We develop a general framework and a set of results on the consistency of invariance-based randomization tests in signal-plus-noise models. Our framework is grounded in the deep mathematical area of representation theory. We allow the transforms to be general compact topological groups, such as rotation groups. Moreover, we allow actions by general linear group representations. We apply our framework to a number of fundamental and highly important problems in statistics, including sparse vector detection, testing for low-rank matrices in noise, sparse detection in linear regression, symmetric submatrix detection, and two-sample testing. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that randomization tests can adapt to problem structure and detect signals at the same rate as tests with full knowledge of the noise distribution.},

abstract = {Single-cell CRISPR screens enable the exploration of mammalian gene function and genetic regulatory networks. However, use of this technology has been limited by reliance on indirect indexing of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Here we present direct-capture Perturb-seq, a versatile screening approach in which expressed sgRNAs are sequenced alongside single-cell transcriptomes. Direct-capture Perturb-seq enables detection of multiple distinct sgRNA sequences from individual cells and thus allows pooled single-cell CRISPR screens to be easily paired with combinatorial perturbation libraries that contain dual-guide expression vectors. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for high-throughput investigations of genetic interactions and, leveraging this ability, dissect epistatic interactions between cholesterol biogenesis and DNA repair. Using direct capture Perturb-seq, we also show that targeting individual genes with multiple sgRNAs per cell improves efficacy of CRISPR interference and activation, facilitating the use of compact, highly active CRISPR libraries for single-cell screens. Last, we show that hybridization-based target enrichment permits sensitive, specific sequencing of informative transcripts from single-cell RNA-seq experiments.},

In this study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of ABEs in the livers of mice and cynomolgus macaques for the reduction of blood low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels. Lipid nanoparticle–based delivery of mRNA encoding an ABE and a single-guide RNA targeting PCSK9, a negative regulator of LDL, induced up to 67{\%} editing (on average, 61{\%}) in mice and up to 34{\%} editing (on average, 26{\%}) in macaques. Plasma PCSK9 and LDL levels were stably reduced by 95{\%} and 58{\%} in mice and by 32{\%} and 14{\%} in macaques, respectively. ABE mRNA was cleared rapidly, and no off-target mutations in genomic DNA were found. Re-dosing in macaques did not increase editing, possibly owing to the detected humoral immune response to ABE upon treatment. These findings support further investigation of ABEs to treat patients with monogenic liver diseases.},

@article{Candes2018,
abstract = {Many contemporary large-scale applications involve building interpretable models linking a large set of potential covariates to a response in a non-linear fashion, such as when the response is binary. Although this modelling problem has been extensively studied, it remains unclear how to control the fraction of false discoveries effectively even in high dimensional logistic regression, not to mention general high dimensional non-linear models. To address such a practical problem, we propose a new framework of ‘model-X' knockoffs, which reads from a different perspective the knockoff procedure that was originally designed for controlling the false discovery rate in linear models. Whereas the knockoffs procedure is constrained to homoscedastic linear models with n⩾p, the key innovation here is that model-X knockoffs provide valid inference from finite samples in settings in which the conditional distribution of the response is arbitrary and completely unknown. Furthermore, this holds no matter the number of covariates. Correct inference in such a broad setting is achieved by constructing knockoff variables probabilistically instead of geometrically. To do this, our approach requires that the covariates are random (independent and identically distributed rows) with a distribution that is known, although we provide preliminary experimental evidence that our procedure is robust to unknown or estimated distributions. To our knowledge, no other procedure solves the controlled variable selection problem in such generality but, in the restricted settings where competitors exist, we demonstrate the superior power of knockoffs through simulations. Finally, we apply our procedure to data from a case–control study of Crohn's disease in the UK, making twice as many discoveries as the original analysis of the same data.},

We propose that the Pearson residuals from "regularized negative binomial regression," where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression.

This situation commonly occurs in health-related applications where the effects of illness are modeled in a multivariate framework and where health conditions are usually 0-1 survey responses indicating the absence or presence of diseases. An analysis of the effect of psychiatric diseases on male earnings provides an empirical example that indicates extensive measurement error bias even in sophisticated survey measures that are designed to simulate clinical diagnoses. A corrected covariance matrix is constructed from a validity study of the survey mental health indicators. When ordinary least squares estimators are adjusted by this correction matrix, the estimated earnings effects drop for certain diseases (drug abuse, general phobic disorders) and rise for others (anti-social personality).},

(Genome Biol 20:295, 2019) recommend fitting a generalized PCA model. Here, we investigate the connection between these approaches theoretically and empirically, and compare their effects on downstream processing. Results: We show that the model of Hafemeister and Satija produces noisy parameter estimates because it is overspecified, which is why the original paper employs post hoc smoothing. When specified more parsimoniously, it has a simple analytic solution equivalent to the rank-one Poisson GLM-PCA of Townes et al. Further, our analysis indicates that per-gene overdispersion estimates in Hafemeister and Satija are biased, and that the data are in fact consistent with the overdispersion parameter being independent of gene expression. We then use negative control data without biological variability to estimate the technical overdispersion of UMI counts, and find that across several different experimental protocols, the data are close to Poisson and suggest very moderate overdispersion. Finally, we perform a benchmark to compare the performance of Pearson residuals, variance-stabilizing transformations, and GLM-PCA on scRNA-seq datasets with known ground truth. Conclusions: We demonstrate that analytic Pearson residuals strongly outperform other methods for identifying biologically variable genes, and capture more of the biologically meaningful variation when used for dimensionality reduction.},

We further performed single-cell CRISPR screening on mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC), and identified key genes associated with different pluripotency states. scMAGeCK enabled an unbiased construction of genotype-phenotype network, where multiple phenotypes can be regulated by different gene perturbations. Finally, we studied key factors that improve the statistical power of single-cell CRISPR screens, including target gene expression and the number of guide RNAs (gRNAs) per cell.

abstract = {Scientists often embed cells into a lower-dimensional space when studying single-cell RNA-seq data for improved downstream analyses such as developmental trajectory analyses, but the statistical properties of such nonlinear embedding methods are often not well understood. In this article, we develop the exponential-family SVD (eSVD), a nonlinear embedding method for both cells and genes jointly with respect to a random dot product model using exponential-family distributions. Our estimator uses alternating minimization, which enables us to have a computationally efficient method, prove the identifiability conditions and consistency of our method, and provide statistically principled procedures to tune our method. All these qualities help advance the single-cell embedding literature, and we provide extensive simulations to demonstrate that the eSVD is competitive compared to other embedding methods. We apply the eSVD via Gaussian distributions where the standard deviations are proportional to the means to analyze a single-cell dataset of oligodendrocytes in mouse brains. Using the eSVD estimated embedding, we then investigate the cell developmental trajectories of the oligodendrocytes. While previous results are not able to distinguish the trajectories among the mature oligodendrocyte cell types, our diagnostics and results demonstrate there are two major developmental trajectories that diverge at mature oligodendrocytes.

abstract = {The majority of variants associated with complex traits and common diseases identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) map to noncoding regions of the genome with unknown regulatory effects in cis and trans . By leveraging biobank-scale GWAS data, massively parallel CRISPR screens and single cell transcriptome sequencing, we discovered target genes of noncoding variants for blood trait loci. The closest gene was often the target gene, but this was not always the case. We also identified trans -effects networks of noncoding variants when cis target genes encoded transcription factors, such as GFI1B and NFE2 . We observed that GFI1B trans -target genes were enriched for GFI1B binding sites and fine-mapped GWAS variants, and expressed in human bone marrow progenitor cells, suggesting that GFI1B acts as a master regulator of blood traits. This platform will enable massively parallel assays to catalog the target genes of human noncoding variants in both cis and trans .

abstract = {Cell atlas projects and high-throughput perturbation screens require single-cell sequencing at a scale that is challenging with current technology. To enable cost-effective single-cell sequencing for millions of individual cells, we developed ‘single-cell combinatorial fluidic indexing' (scifi). The scifi-RNA-seq assay combines one-step combinatorial preindexing of entire transcriptomes inside permeabilized cells with subsequent single-cell RNA-seq using microfluidics. Preindexing allows us to load several cells per droplet and computationally demultiplex their individual expression profiles. Thereby, scifi-RNA-seq massively increases the throughput of droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq, and provides a straightforward way of multiplexing thousands of samples in a single experiment. Compared with multiround combinatorial indexing, scifi-RNA-seq provides an easy and efficient workflow. Compared to cell hashing methods, which flag and discard droplets containing more than one cell, scifi-RNA-seq resolves and retains individual transcriptomes from overloaded droplets. We benchmarked scifi-RNA-seq on various human and mouse cell lines, validated it for primary human T cells and applied it in a highly multiplexed CRISPR screen with single-cell transcriptome readout of T cell receptor activation.},

The most serious objection to the method was that it involves splitting data at random, and so different people analyzing the same data may get very different answers. Using e-values instead of p-values remedies this disadvantage.},

abstract = {Heterogeneity in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data is driven by multiple sources, including biological variation in cellular state as well as technical variation introduced during experimental processing. Deconvolving these effects is a key challenge for preprocessing workflows. Recent work has demonstrated the importance and utility of count models for scRNA-seq analysis, but there is a lack of consensus on which statistical distributions and parameter settings are appropriate. Here, we analyze 58 scRNA-seq datasets that span a wide range of technologies, systems, and sequencing depths in order to evaluate the performance of different error models. We find that while a Poisson error model appears appropriate for sparse datasets, we observe clear evidence of overdispersion for genes with sufficient sequencing depth in all biological systems, necessitating the use of a negative binomial model. Moreover, we find that the degree of overdispersion varies widely across datasets, systems, and gene abundances, and argues for a data-driven approach for parameter estimation. Based on these analyses, we provide a set of recommendations for modeling variation in scRNA-seq data, particularly when using generalized linear models or likelihood-based approaches for preprocessing and downstream analysis.

abstract = {We consider the problem of conditional independence testing: given a response Y and co- variates (X, Z), we test the null hypothesis that Y ⊥⊥ X | Z. The conditional randomization test was recently proposed as a way to use distributional information about X | Z to exactly and non-asymptotically control Type-I error using any test statistic in any dimensionality without assuming anything about Y | (X, Z). This flexibility, in principle, allows one to derive powerful 20 test statistics from complex prediction algorithms while maintaining statistical validity. Yet the direct use of such advanced test statistics in the conditional randomization test is prohibitively computationally expensive, especially with multiple testing, due to the requirement to recompute the test statistic many times on resampled data. We propose the distilled conditional randomiza- tion test, a novel approach to using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in the conditional 25 randomization test while drastically reducing the number of times those algorithms need to be run, thereby taking advantage of their power and the conditional randomization test's statistical guarantees without suffering the usual computational expense. In addition to distillation, we pro- pose a number of other tricks like screening and recycling computations to further speed up the conditional randomization test without sacrificing its high power and exact validity. Indeed, we 30 show in simulations that all our proposals combined lead to a test that has similar power to the most powerful existing conditional randomization test implementations but requires orders of magnitude less computation, making it a practical tool even for large data sets. We demonstrate these benefits on a breast cancer dataset by identifying biomarkers related to cancer stage.},

abstract = {For testing conditional independence (CI) of a response Y and a predictor X given covariates Z, the recently introduced model-X (MX) framework has been the subject of active methodological research, especially in the context of MX knockoffs and their successful application to genome-wide association studies. In this paper, we study the power of MX CI tests, yielding quantitative explanations for empirically observed phenomena and novel insights to guide the design of MX methodology. We show that any valid MX CI test must also be valid conditionally on Y and Z; this conditioning allows us to reformulate the problem as testing a point null hypothesis involving the conditional distribution of X. The Neyman-Pearson lemma then implies that the conditional randomization test (CRT) based on a likelihood statistic is the most powerful MX CI test against a point alternative. We also obtain a related optimality result for MX knockoffs. Switching to an asymptotic framework with arbitrarily growing covariate dimension, we derive an expression for the limiting power of the CRT against local semiparametric alternatives in terms of the prediction error of the machine learning algorithm on which its test statistic is based. Finally, we exhibit a resampling-free test with uniform asymptotic Type-I error control under the assumption that only the first two moments of X given Z are known, a significant relaxation of the MX assumption.},
